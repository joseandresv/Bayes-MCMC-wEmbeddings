Jean-M Cardebat,white,A1,10.0,1,0,"After hand-picking, whole cluster pressing, and complete primary malo-lactic fermentation in the barrel (which are 50% new French), the wine was aged sur-lie for 12 months. The final product is a wine of balance and restraint with underlying power. You can smell and taste the flinty soil. After bottle aging for a year the limey, lemony flavors and aromas are starting to become more apparent."
Jean-M Cardebat,white,B1,13.0,1,0,"This enticing Sauvignon Blanc offers a beautiful combination of freshness and complexity. The aromas are rich and layered with elements of pineapple, guava, peach and lemon zest. On the palate, the entry is crisp and inviting with good acidity supporting flavors of lemon meringue, grapefruit, pear and flint. The addition of Semillon ccentuates the wine's tropical notes with subtle oak adding nuance and dimension. "
Jean-M Cardebat,white,C1,14.0,0,0,"Our 2013 Gewurztraminer displays classic rose and ginger aromatics. The concentration of the vintage is apparent in the mouth, there is great texture to balance the abundant fruit. We strive for balance, this grape seems almost naturally prone to excess, with great interplay between acid and fruit. This balance is key with great Gewurztraminers, both in texture and flavor. The 2013 vintage is a showy vintage, yet and displays the floral notes, tropical fruit, and spice flavors that are the hallmarks of Thomas Fogarty Gewurztraminer. "
Jean-M Cardebat,white,D1,15.0,0,0,"""Light gold. A stunning bouquet offers powerful pear, peach pit, anise, salty minerality and a huge wallop of smoky peat-this smells like an Islay whisky! Painfully concentrated pit fruit flavors are complemented by orange peel, clove and smoked meat, but there's an elegance to this that's reminiscent of a top-notch Burgundy. A simply remarkable wine, with uncanny complexity and depth of flavor."""
Jean-M Cardebat,white,E1,8.0,1,0,"This is perhaps the most elegant Chardonnay ever produced by Chalk Hill.  The wine displays the tropical fruit and mineral characteristics of the estate, and is delicately infused with citrus, pear and honeysuckle, an imprint from the cool vintage conditions."
Jean-M Cardebat,white,F1,13.0,1,0,"This Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc is lively, and bright with aromasof citrus blossom, grapefruit and lemongrass. It's intense flavorbursts with refreshing fruit on the palate. White peach, grapefruit,and tropical fruit notes are followed by balanced minerality that iscomplemented by a long, rich finish. Enjoy with oysters, shrimpscampi, grilled fish or even fried chicken. It is also great on its ownwith friends and family. Cheers!"
Jean-M Cardebat,white,G1,15.0,1,0,"This cuvee's complexity and finesse stem from the harmony between the structure, richness, and power from the Marnes soil and the light, floral fruitiness lent by the Caillottes. This double origin gives this wine its remarkable personality."
Jean-M Cardebat,white,H1,11.0,0,0,"The spectacular 2010 vintage in the Chalone appellation gave this Chardonnay its highly nuanced flavors and exceptional structure.  The cool temperatures allowed us to patiently wait for wonderfully ripe flavors, revealed in the wine as layers of peach, pear and citrus, while the pronounced minerality and silky texture come from our unique terroir.  As always, right after bottling, I found fresh, lemony notes predominating in the aromas, but it is now starting to develop the complex brioche nuances that I love in this wine as it ages."
Jean-M Cardebat,white,I1,9.0,1,0,"The French say “Enchanté” when they greet each other. Andrew Murray has named their Estate-Grown, signature white blend of Grenache Blanc and Roussanne after this expression. These two varieties are truly yin and yang. Roussanne is rich and unctuous, while Grenache Blanc is bright and racy. The two complement each other perfectly! The winery fermented and aged this wine in older French Oak barrels, which lends a beautifully smooth texture to this dry white wine. "
Jean-M Cardebat,white,J1,12.0,0,0,Pale gold color. Very refreshing aromas of citrus fruit (grapefruit) mixed with fresh honey enhanced by a hint of minerality. Well-structured and tense. Well-integrated acidity and beautiful minerality. Energetic aftertaste.

As always, right after bottling, I found fresh, lemony notes predominating in the aromas, but it is now starting to develop the complex brioche nuances that I love in this wine as it ages."
Jamal Rayyis,white,I1,13.0,1,0,"The French say “Enchanté” when they greet each other. Andrew Murray has named their Estate-Grown, signature white blend of Grenache Blanc and Roussanne after this expression. These two varieties are truly yin and yang. Roussanne is rich and unctuous, while Grenache Blanc is bright and racy. The two complement each other perfectly! The winery fermented and aged this wine in older French Oak barrels, which lends a beautifully smooth texture to this dry white wine. "
Jamal Rayyis,white,J1,12.0,0,0,Pale gold color. Very refreshing aromas of citrus fruit (grapefruit) mixed with fresh honey enhanced by a hint of minerality. Well-structured and tense. Well-integrated acidity and beautiful minerality. Energetic aftertaste.
Francis Schott,white,A1,17.0,1,1,"After hand-picking, whole cluster pressing, and complete primary malo-lactic fermentation in the barrel (which are 50% new French), the wine was aged sur-lie for 12 months. The final product is a wine of balance and restraint with underlying power. You can smell and taste the flinty soil. After bottle aging for a year the limey, lemony flavors and aromas are starting to become more apparent."
Francis Schott,white,B1,16.0,1,1,"This enticing Sauvignon Blanc offers a beautiful combination of freshness and complexity. The aromas are rich and layered with elements of pineapple, guava, peach and lemon zest. On the palate, the entry is crisp and inviting with good acidity supporting flavors of lemon meringue, grapefruit, pear and flint. The addition of Semillon ccentuates the wine's tropical notes with subtle oak adding nuance and dimension. "
Francis Schott,white,C1,12.0,0,1,"Our 2013 Gewurztraminer displays classic rose and ginger aromatics. The concentration of the vintage is apparent in the mouth, there is great texture to balance the abundant fruit. We strive for balance, this grape seems almost naturally prone to excess, with great interplay between acid and fruit. This balance is key with great Gewurztraminers, both in texture and flavor. The 2013 vintage is a showy vintage, yet and displays the floral notes, tropical fruit, and spice flavors that are the hallmarks of Thomas Fogarty Gewurztraminer. "
Francis Schott,white,D1,18.0,0,1,"""Light gold. A stunning bouquet offers powerful pear, peach pit, anise, salty minerality and a huge wallop of smoky peat-this smells like an Islay whisky! Painfully concentrated pit fruit flavors are complemented by orange peel, clove and smoked meat, but there's an elegance to this that's reminiscent of a top-notch Burgundy. A simply remarkable wine, with uncanny complexity and depth of flavor."""
Francis Schott,white,E1,15.0,1,1,"This is perhaps the most elegant Chardonnay ever produced by Chalk Hill.  The wine displays the tropical fruit and mineral characteristics of the estate, and is delicately infused with citrus, pear and honeysuckle, an imprint from the cool vintage conditions."
Francis Schott,white,F1,16.0,1,1,"This Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc is lively, and bright with aromasof citrus blossom, grapefruit and lemongrass. It's intense flavorbursts with refreshing fruit on the palate. White peach, grapefruit,and tropical fruit notes are followed by balanced minerality that iscomplemented by a long, rich finish. Enjoy with oysters, shrimpscampi, grilled fish or even fried chicken. It is also great on its ownwith friends and family. Cheers!"
Francis Schott,white,G1,15.0,1,1,"This cuvee's complexity and finesse stem from the harmony between the structure, richness, and power from the Marnes soil and the light, floral fruitiness lent by the Caillottes. This double origin gives this wine its remarkable personality."

Powerful and seamless in texture, with densely packed, fine-grain tannins,  a graphite-like minerality, and a savory, long-lasting finish."
Francis Schott,red,C2,8.0,1,1,"Blend: 60% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon"
Francis Schott,red,D2,15.0,1,1,"Deep garnet color. Notes of red cherries, plums and bilberries with a hint of violets and dried roses. Long, soft, well-rounded finish."
Francis Schott,red,E2,15.0,1,1,"This wine delivers everything one is looking for from a great vintage. The color is an inky purple hue and the wine has aromas of black fruits, baking spices, dark chocolate and leather. The palate is rich and complex, full of flavors of berry pie, mocha, cedar, black pepper and vanilla toast. The texture is creamy, round and full with structured tannins that are approachable now or will cellar well for decades."
Francis Schott,red,F2,12.0,1,1,"A cascade of aromatics starts with a bright floral note of tea rose oil before descending through cassis and blackberry, with a hint of barrel toast and crushed graphite. An incredibly tight weave of refined tannins holds the center core firmly in place, wrapped as it is with a lush layer of black fruit.  Blackberry bramble and cassis are infused with a crushed stone character that brightens the richness across the palate and lingers for a long arching finish."
Francis Schott,red,G2,15.0,0,1,"We named this wine in homage of a wonderful restaurant and inn in Vezelay, named L'Esperance. We used the inn as a home-base for much of our early explorations into the Rhône Valley and fell in love with the wines of the southern Rhône region. "
Francis Schott,red,H2,16.0,1,1,"The 1999 vintage was harvested a few days later than normal because of a cool summer. However, the conditions were ideal and the fruit maturity levels were textbook. The aroma and flavor the 1999 Cabernet Sauvignon are truly an extension of the vineyard and display the Estate-grown complexity our vineyard is known for. The finish is full, rich and rewarding. This wine will complement foods of robust style and will continue to develop with proper aging. "
Francis Schott,red,I2,7.0,1,1,"Wonderful berry fruit, subtle, chalky tannins and a superb balance of acidity.  This wine would pair well with lentil dishes, red meats and game, sharp cheeses and dark chocolate. "
Francis Schott,red,J2,17.0,0,1,"A subtle and intoxicating blend of rose petals, wild berries, bacon smoke, crushed red rocks, and wood. The power and grace of this wine provides an incredibly balanced structure to last at least two decades. This wine will be a staff favorite for years to come."
